Multiagent Financial Advisory Platform
In modern times there are different asset classes to appreciate capital of an individual. Capital market is one such proven way. 
NIFTY-50 which is the benchmark index of top 50 companies in India has generated a return of 10% CAGR. Where as many small cap companies have generated a hefty return of 15% to 18% in the same time.
FinMentor AI MVP is a standalone web application designed to provide basic financial education and advisory services to Indian retain investors.
The chatbot is designed to build sophisticated portfolio based on an investors risk perception.
In addition to building portfolio, the application is capable of educating new investors and giving summary of annual reports.

Problem Statement
THE FINANCIAL LITERACY GAP IN INDIA
Only 27% of Indian adults are financially literate (NCFE Survey 2023)
Retail investors lack personalized guidance
Traditional financial advisors are expensive (₹5000-10000/consultation)
Generic investment apps don't educate users
Information overload - 5500+ stocks on BSE, where to start?

Real-World Impact:
Poor investment decisions due to lack of knowledge
Missed wealth creation opportunities
Emotional investing (panic selling, FOMO buying)
No understanding of risk-return tradeoffs

Target Users: Young professionals (20-45) entering capital markets

Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
Robo-Advisors (Zerodha Coin, Groww):
Automated portfolio suggestions
No educational component
One-size-fits-all approach
No conversational interface

Financial Chatbots (MoneyBot, Fina):
Answer basic questions
Limited to FAQs
No portfolio building capability
No context awareness


Human Financial Advisors:
Personalized advice
Expensive (₹5000+/session)
Not scalable
Not available 24/7


THE GAP: No solution combines education + advisory + personalization + 24/7 availability + affordable cost

Project Objectives
Intelligent multi-agent financial advisory: Creates a system with specialized AI agents that collaborate to provide comprehensive financial advice. Developed smart orchestration with dependency aware execution. 
Context aware conversational memory: To build a system that remembers and learns from past conversations. Implement agentic RAG with PGVector semantic search. Intent classification with 6 query types.
Real-time market integration: This provides accurate an up-to-date market data and analysis. Yahoo finance integration for live stock prices. Technical indicator calculations such as RSI, MACD, Moving average.
Educational financial platform: Make financial literacy accessible to everyone. Angel one scraped data that contains more than 500 terms.

Literature Review - Multi-Agent Systems in Finance
1. Multi-Agent Trading Systems
   Reference: Xiao et al. (2024) - "TradingAgents: Multi-agents 
   LLM financial trading framework"
   Key Findings:
Specialized agents outperform single-agent systems
Agent collaboration improves decision accuracy by 23%
LLM-based agents can process unstructured financial data
https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138

2. RAG for Financial QA
   Reference: Choi et al. (2025) - "FinDER: Financial dataset for 
   question answering and evaluating RAG"
   Key Findings:
RAG improves factual accuracy in financial responses
Retrieval-based methods reduce hallucinations
Domain-specific knowledge bases essential
https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15800
3. LLM-Based Portfolio Recommendations
    Reference: Lopez-Lira, A., Scheer, M., & Schwenkler, G. (2024) - "Using Large Language Models for Financial Advice"
    Key Findings:
LLMs can generate implementable portfolio recommendations with specific securities and weights
Foundation models generate portfolios more sensitive to investor characteristics than fine-tuned models

4. GenAI and Retail Investor Behavior
    Reference: Cao, S., Jiang, W., & Wang, J. (2024) - "Generative AI and Investor Processing of Financial Information"
Key Findings:
Nearly 50% of retail investors already use GenAI for financial information processing
GenAI enhances ability to process complex financial information quickly
More sophisticated investors leverage GenAI for complex tasks more effectively
