1. INTRODUCTION


   1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Financial literacy and effective portfolio management remain significant challenges for individual investors, particularly beginners entering the investment landscape. Traditional financial advisory services are often expensive, lack personalization, or require substantial minimum investments, creating a barrier for many individuals seeking financial guidance. Furthermore, the complexity of financial markets, coupled with the abundance of information available, can overwhelm novice investors, leading to suboptimal investment decisions or complete avoidance of financial planning.
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence has opened new possibilities for democratizing financial advice. However, existing AI-powered financial tools often suffer from limitations:
1. Single-agent architectures that cannot provide comprehensive, multi-faceted analysis
2. Lack of specialization in different financial domains (risk assessment, portfolio optimization, behavioral finance)
3. Limited context awareness without proper retrieval mechanisms for personalized advice
4. Generic responses that fail to consider user-specific risk tolerance, goals, and experience levels.


FinMentor AI addresses these gaps by introducing a multi-agent orchestration system that combines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with specialized financial agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and real-time market data integration. The system provides comprehensive, personalized financial guidance through an intelligent conversational interface.
        1.2        PROBLEM STATMENT
1. Primary Problem: Individual investors, especially beginners, lack access to affordable, comprehensive, and personalized financial guidance that considers multiple aspects of investment decision-making including risk assessment, portfolio optimization, tax implications, and behavioral biases.
2. Complexity of Financial Decision-Making: Investment decisions require analysis across multiple dimensions. No single source provides integrated, comprehensive analysis.
3. Lack of Personalization: Generic financial advice fails to account for individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and knowledge levels.

                2.        LITERATURE REVIEW
        2.1        EXISTING FINANCIAL AI SYSTEMS
                Commercial Solutions
Commercial financial AI solutions have evolved significantly in recent years, encompassing robo-advisors, chatbots, and automated trading platforms that leverage various technological approaches to democratize financial services[1]. Robo-advisors represent a major category of automated investment management systems that provide portfolio recommendations based on investor profiles, risk preferences, and financial goals. These platforms typically employ rule-based algorithms and quantitative models to construct and rebalance portfolios.


Traditional chatbots in the financial sector are designed to handle customer inquiries, provide basic financial information, and assist with routine transactions. However, these early systems often suffer from limitations in handling complex financial queries and lack the ability to provide contextual, nuanced advice[2]. Recent advancements have introduced generative AI-powered chatbots that can process natural language queries and generate more sophisticated financial insights. A comprehensive survey of 2,175 retail investors reveals that nearly half of surveyed investors are already using generative AI for gathering and interpreting financial or market data[3]. 


Academic Research Systems
Academic research has explored various approaches to building intelligent financial systems. Early systems focused on sentiment analysis from news and social media to predict market movements. More recent research has concentrated on developing specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on financial data, such as FinGPT, PIXIU (FinMA), and BloombergGPT[1].        
Fine-tuned LLMs demonstrate significant improvements in domain-specific tasks compared to their base versions. For example, PIXIU outperformed open-source models like BLOOM and OPT in financial sentiment analysis tasks. However, studies show that while these specialized models excel in classification tasks, they perform similarly or slightly worse than general-purpose models like GPT-4 in generative tasks requiring complex financial reasoning[1].
2.2         MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM IN FINANCE
                Agent Architectures
Multi-agent LLM frameworks represent a significant advancement in financial AI by simulating the collaborative decision-making processes of real trading firms. The TradingAgents framework exemplifies this approach by organizing specialized agents with distinct roles, mirroring the structure of professional trading organizations[1].


The framework employs a hierarchical agent architecture comprising several distinct teams:
* Fundamental Analysts evaluate company financial statements, earnings reports, and insider transactions to assess intrinsic value.
* Sentiment Analysts process social media posts and sentiment scores to gauge market sentiment.
* News Analysts analyze news articles and macroeconomic indicators to identify market-moving events.
* Technical Analysts calculate technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) to forecast price movements[1].
Researcher Team: Composed of bullish and bearish researchers who engage in structured debates to evaluate investment opportunities from opposing perspectives, providing balanced market assessment[1].
Trader Agents: Execute trading decisions based on comprehensive analysis from analysts and researchers, determining timing and size of trades while balancing potential returns against risks[1].
Risk Management Team: Monitors portfolio exposure from three perspectives (risk-seeking, neutral, and risk-conservative), ensuring trading activities remain within predefined risk parameters[1].
Fund Manager: Reviews risk management deliberations and approves final trading decisions with appropriate adjustments[1].
Coordination Strategies
Traditional multi-agent systems in finance have relied heavily on natural language communication through unstructured message histories or pools of information. However, this approach often results in information degradation over extended decision sequences, similar to a "telephone effect" where details are lost and states become corrupted[1].
TradingAgents addresses this limitation through a hybrid communication protocol that combines structured outputs with natural language dialogue. This innovative coordination strategy operates as follows:
Structured Communication: Analyst reports, trader decision documents, and risk assessments are maintained as structured entries in a global agent state. Each agent queries the necessary information directly from this shared state rather than relying on conversational history[1].
Focused Natural Language Dialogue: Natural language communication is reserved exclusively for agent-to-agent debates and discussions among the Researcher and Risk Management teams. These focused, multi-round discussions promote deeper reasoning and integrate diverse perspectives while avoiding the information loss inherent in long conversational exchanges[1].
ReAct Framework Implementation: All agents employ the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) prompting framework, which synergizes reasoning and acting within a shared environment context. This enables agents to take context-appropriate actions such as conducting research, executing trades, or managing risks[1].


        2.3        RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)
                RAG Fundamentals
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that augments Large Language Models with external knowledge by retrieving and integrating relevant documents into the response generation process[2]. RAG addresses fundamental limitations of LLMs in finance by combining the semantic understanding capabilities of language models with the precision of information retrieval systems.


The basic RAG pipeline operates as follows: Given a user query, a retrieval component searches a document corpus to identify relevant passages. These passages are then provided as context to an LLM for answer generation, enabling the model to produce responses grounded in external knowledge rather than relying solely on training data[2].


RAG has become essential for financial question-answering because while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4-turbo achieve only 9% accuracy on financial queries in closed-book settings, providing relevant context dramatically improves performance[2]. The FINDER dataset evaluation demonstrates that models receiving perfect context achieve correctness scores of 59.69% to 68.13%, compared to only 9.37% to 10.14% without context[2]. The FinDER (Financial Dataset for Evaluating RAG) benchmark, consisting of 5,703 expert-annotated query-evidence-answer triplets from real-world financial inquiries, demonstrates the practical challenges and opportunities in this domain[2].
        2.4        LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR FINANCE
                GPT Models, Gemini, and Claude
The capabilities of leading LLMs for financial applications have been extensively evaluated across multiple dimensions. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-o1, and Claude are among the most prominent models tested in financial contexts[1][2][3].


Foundation Model Performance
Research on financial advice generation reveals that larger foundation models (e.g., GPT-4) generate portfolios that are more sensitive to investor characteristics, easier to implement, and more aligned with best practices than smaller or fine-tuned models[3]. When evaluating portfolio recommendations across 64 investor profiles differing in risk preferences, country, sustainability preferences, gender, and investment experience, GPT-4 produces recommendations with historical performance comparable to professionally managed benchmark portfolios[3].


Multi-LLM Comparison in Financial QA: In the FINDER evaluation, different LLMs demonstrate varying strengths:
* GPT-o1: Excels in arithmetic operations (Multiplication: 42.90%, Division: 27.78%) with strong faithfulness (80.33%-84.15%)
* Claude-3.7-Sonnet: Achieves highest faithfulness scores (85.46% in qualitative tasks) and good arithmetic performance.
* Qwen-QWQ: Demonstrates strong performance in specialized domains (Legal: 80.22%, Risk: 80.32%).
* Deepseek-R1-Distill: Shows category-specific strengths (Accounting: 84.71%), balancing reasoning with efficiency[2].
No single model universally dominates across all financial reasoning tasks, suggesting that architectural nuances significantly influence performance on specific tasks[2].
        2.5        GAP ANALYSIS: LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES
                Limitations of Existing Systems
Despite significant progress, current financial AI systems face several critical limitations:
1. Limited Organizational Realism: Most existing multi-agent frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions and organizational structures of real trading firms. Traditional systems focus narrowly on specific task performance (sentiment analysis, price prediction, or news processing) without integrating the established workflows and human operating procedures proven effective in professional trading environments[1]. This fragmented approach limits their ability to replicate real-world trading practices and organizational decision-making processes.
2. Inefficient Communication Interfaces: Heavy reliance on natural language communication through message histories or unstructured information pools leads to significant information degradation over extended decision sequences[1]. The "telephone effect"—where details are lost and states become corrupted as conversations lengthen—impairs agent effectiveness in handling complex, dynamic tasks. Agents struggle to maintain context while filtering irrelevant information from previous decision steps, diminishing their capacity to handle sophisticated financial reasoning[1].
3. Hallucination and Factual Inaccuracy: LLMs struggle with factual correctness in financial domains without proper context. GPT-4-turbo achieved only 9% accuracy on financial questions in closed-book settings, with 91% of responses being incorrect or unanswered[2]. Even with context, models typically achieve only 30%-34% correctness on qualitative financial reasoning tasks, rising to 59%-68% only with high-quality, expertly-selected context[2].
4. Query Ambiguity and Domain-Specific Language: Existing retrieval systems struggle with the brevity, ambiguity, and specialized terminology common in real-world financial queries[2]. Financial queries frequently contain multiple acronyms and domain-specific expressions—43.45% of real financial queries contain 3-4 domain-specific terms, and 46.41% contain 5 or more[2].
5. Variable Performance Across Financial Reasoning Types: LLMs demonstrate inconsistent capabilities across different financial reasoning tasks. Compositional reasoning (requiring integration of multiple information sources) achieves only 19-20% correctness, while arithmetic operations vary from 15-42% depending on operation type[2].

                3.3.4    RAG Module
The main purpose is to retrieve relevant context from the knowledge base and conversation history.
Key Components
* Agentic RAG: The IntentClassifier is a DSPy signature designed to identify the user’s intent from a given query so the system can route the request to the correct agent.It takes the query as an input field.
* It produces the query as an input field.
   * Intent- A label identifying the category of the users request.
   * Confidence- A numerical score between 0 and 1 that expresses how confident the model is in the predicted intent. This classifier helps the system decide which module or agent should handle the users message, ensuring accurate routing and response generation.
* Retrieval strategies:
   * Conversation history: PGVector similarity search on message.
   * Education content: PGVector similarity search on knowledge base.
   * Market data: Direct API calls to finance.
* Vector search 
   * The retrieve_from_conversations function performs a similarity search across stored conversation messages. It takes a query embedding and returns the top K most similar messages based on vector distance.
   * It constructs a SQL query that selects each message’s content, role, timestamp, and its distance from the query embedding.
   * It filters only messages that already have embeddings stored.
   * It returns only the top k most relevant messages.
* Embedding storage
   * The store_message_embedding function runs in the background and is responsible for generating and storing embeddings for new messages.
   * Given a message ID and its text context, it calls the OpenAI embedding API to generate a vector representation of the message.
   * Once the embeddings is generated , it updates the corresponding message row in the database by saving the embedding vector in the embedding column.
   * This entire process runs asynchronous so it dosent slow down the main request flow.
